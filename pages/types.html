    <h2>TS crash course by Arin Bagul</h2>
    <p>
        Type represents which type of data a variable can hold. In some languages it is also known as Data Type. In
        TypeScript, type is classified in two:
    <ol>
        <li>Primitive Type: number, string, boolean, character, undefined</li>

        <span class="code_block">
            <span>let a = 5;</span>
            <span>let b = a;</span>
            <span>b = b + 2;</span>
            <span><br></span>
            <span>console.log(a);</span>
            <span>console.log(b);</span>

            <br>// b will become 7 but a is still 5.
        </span>

        <li>Reference Type: array, class, object</li>

        <span class="code_block">
            <span>let a = [1,2,3,4];</span>
            <span>let b = a;</span>
            <span>b.pop();</span>
            <span><br></span>
            <span>console.log(a);</span>
            <span>console.log(b);</span>

            <br>/* <br>
            here at first a = [1,2,3,4]<br>
            we are popping out from b<br>
            now b = [1,2,3]<br>
            but also a = [1,2,3]<br>
            */<br>
        </span>
    </ol>
    <b>Basic types in TS are: </b>
    <ul>
        <li>number, string, character, boolean, undefined</li>
        <li>Array, Tuple</li>
        <li>any, never, void, unknown</li>
        <li>Class, Object, Enum</li>
    </ul>
