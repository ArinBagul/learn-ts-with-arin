    <p>
        TypeScript is a free, open source, high level programming language, developed by Microsoft. It is developed to
        deal with the shortcoming of JavaScript. The extension of a TypeScript file is <b class="code">.ts</b>. It is the superset of
        JavaScript, means every correct JavaScript code can be compiled in TypeScript but can produce some warnings.
        It's main feature is that, every entity has a type.
